Using the rsdmx package, we can get a table of all dataflows available from the UNICEF API:\n\nall_unicef_dataflows &lt;- rsdmx::readSDMX(\n  providerId = \"UNICEF\", \n  resource = \"dataflow\"\n) |&gt; \n  dplyr::as_tibble()\n\n[rsdmx][INFO] Fetching 'https://sdmx.data.unicef.org/ws/public/sdmxapi/rest/dataflow/all/all/latest/' \n\n\n\ndplyr::glimpse(all_unicef_dataflows)\n\nRows: 167\nColumns: 12\n$ id                  &lt;chr&gt; \"BRAZIL_CO\", \"BRAZIL_CO_SELO\", \"CAP2030\", \"CD2030\"…\n$ agencyID            &lt;chr&gt; \"BRAZIL_CO\", \"BRAZIL_CO\", \"CAP2030\", \"CD2030\", \"CD…\n$ Name.en             &lt;chr&gt; \"Brazil Country Office\", \"Brazil SELO\", \"CAP 2030\"…\n$ version             &lt;chr&gt; \"1.0\", \"1.0\", \"1.0\", \"1.0\", \"1.0\", \"1.0\", \"1.0\", \"…\n$ uri                 &lt;chr&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA…\n$ urn                 &lt;chr&gt; \"urn:sdmx:org.sdmx.infomodel.datastructure.Dataflo…\n$ isExternalReference &lt;lgl&gt; FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, F…\n$ isFinal             &lt;lgl&gt; FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, F…\n$ validFrom           &lt;chr&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA…\n$ validTo             &lt;chr&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA…\n$ dsdRef              &lt;chr&gt; \"DSD_BRAZIL_CO\", \"DSD_BRAZIL_CO_SELO\", \"CAP2030\", …\n$ Description.en      &lt;chr&gt; NA, NA, NA, \"This dataset is used to support the d…\n\n\nNow let’s filter down to dataflows that mention education in their “Name.en” field:\n\nall_unicef_dataflows |&gt; \n  dplyr::filter(\n    stringr::str_detect(Name.en, stringr::fixed(\"education\", ignore_case = TRUE))\n  ) |&gt; \n  dplyr::select(id, agencyID, Name.en, dsdRef)\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 4\n  id              agencyID       Name.en                                dsdRef  \n  &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;chr&gt;                                  &lt;chr&gt;   \n1 EDU             MENARO         MENARO Education                       MENARO_…\n2 UIS_EDU         UNESCO         UNESCO UIS Education                   UIS     \n3 EDU_NON_FINANCE UNESCO_ARCHIVE Education: Students and Teachers       EDU_NON…\n4 EDUCATION       UNICEF         Education                              EDUCATI…\n5 EDUCATION_FLS   UNICEF         Education Foundational Learning Skills EDUCATI…\n\n\nLet’s say we want to explore the UNICEF dataflow with id equal to “EDUCATION”.

The list passed to key will be assumed to correspond to the first “n” dimensions (where n is the length of the list).\nTo work with the data in R, we need to transform them from XML to an R data.frame or tibble:\n\nafrican_education_data_as_list &lt;- XML::xmlToList(african_education_data@xmlObj)\n\n\nafrican_education_data_points &lt;- african_education_data_as_list$DataSet[\n  names(african_education_data_as_list$DataSet) == \"Series\"\n]\n\nafrican_education_data_as_tibble &lt;- purrr::map(\n  african_education_data_points,\n  function(datapoint) {\n    obs_data &lt;- purrr::map(datapoint$Obs, ~.x)\n    dimension_data &lt;- purrr::map(datapoint$.attrs, ~.x)\n    dplyr::bind_cols(dimension_data, obs_data)\n  }\n) |&gt; \n  purrr::list_rbind()\n\nNow let’s filter to only totals by sex, wealth quintile, and residence, and select and rename only the columns we want:\n\nafrican_education_data_cleaned &lt;- african_education_data_as_tibble |&gt; \n  dplyr::filter(\n    dplyr::if_all(c(SEX, WEALTH_QUINTILE, RESIDENCE), ~.x == \"_T\")\n  ) |&gt; \n  dplyr::left_join(\n    african_country_codes |&gt; \n      dplyr::select(REF_AREA = code, country_name = standard_label), \n    by = \"REF_AREA\"\n  ) |&gt; \n  dplyr::select(\n    country_name, \n    year = TIME_PERIOD, \n    percent_completing_secondary = OBS_VALUE,\n    data_source = DATA_SOURCE\n  ) |&gt; \n  dplyr::mutate(\n    percent_completing_secondary = as.numeric(percent_completing_secondary)\n  )\n\nNow we’re ready to plot our data:\n\nafrican_education_data_cleaned |&gt; \n  ggplot2::ggplot(\n    ggplot2::aes(\n      x = forcats::fct_reorder(country_name, percent_completing_secondary), \n      y = percent_completing_secondary\n    )\n  ) + \n    ggplot2::geom_col() +\n    ggplot2::coord_flip() +\n    ggplot2::labs(\n      title = \"Upper secondary completion rate, selected African countries\",\n      y = \"% completing upper secondary\",\n      x = \"Country\",\n      caption = \"Source: UNICEF\"\n    )"
